A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

CODE:

PYTHON
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        b=s.split()
        c=len(b[-1])
        return c

You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.


Example 1:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

CODE:
class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<items.size();i++){
                if(ruleKey.equals("color")){
                    if((items.get(i)).get(1).equals(ruleValue)){
                        count=count+1;
                    }
                }
                else if(ruleKey.equals("type")){
                    if((items.get(i)).get(0).equals(ruleValue)){
                        count=count+1;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    if((items.get(i)).get(2).equals(ruleValue)){
                        count=count+1;
                    }
                }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
